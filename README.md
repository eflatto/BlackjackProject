# Blackjack Project

# Description
Blackjack is a popular card game played between a dealer and player(s). The objective of the game is to have a hand value of 21 or closest to 21 without busting.

The game starts with a welcome message and shuffling the deck of cards. The user is then dealt two cards and the dealer is dealt one card face up and one face down. The player can either choose to hit or stay. The game continues until the player busts or decides to stay. The dealer will then reveal their hand and the winner will be determined based on who is closest to 21 without busting.

 The game also has the option to play again. If the deck runs out of cards, the game will end and the user will have to start over.
